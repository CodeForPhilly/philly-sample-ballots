# Philly Sample Ballots
Crowdsource capturing those influential hand-outs at polling places.

We're using a [hackpad][hackpad] for ongoing documentation.

## Development
First, install [Node.js][Node.js]. We recommend installing [yarn][yarn] to use
in place of npm, but you can use npm instead.

1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the API hostname
2. Install dependencies via `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
3. Run a development server via `yarn start` (or `npm start`)

To build a production version of the app, use `yarn run build` (or `npm run
build`).
